                    <p>This page is a showcase for various 3D models i have produced as part of school courses, game projects and for my own purposes.</p>

                    <h1>3D Modeling course project: Megaman X</h1>
                    <p>This character model was created during my first year 3D modeling course at XAMK. It was made as the final assignment of the course, which was to create a humanoid character and apply both a skeleton and textures to it, finally use a premade animation from mixamo to animate it.</p>
                    <p>I chose to create a rendition of the videogame character "X" from Megaman X series.</p>

                    <h1>Island diorama</h1>
                    <p>Created based on tutorials from GameDev.TV, i followed the tutorial during my summer TBS project to improve my modeling skills.</p>
                    <p>The part that this diorama was created in included subjects like materials (modifying with nodes and using material slots to add multiple materials), basic scultping and lighting techniques.</p>
                    <p>The end result being this island scene with a lighthouse and a small village. <br>
                    While this wasn't a complex model, i learned more about blender sculpting and how materials work in the current version.</p>

                    <h1>Modular Dungeon</h1>
                    <p>Continuing from the same tutorial series, The next subject was the creation of a modular dungeon using reuseable props.</p>
                    <p>The first props created were: A barrel, a crate and a set of pillars. <br>
                    During the creation of these the primary new tools introduced were: Inset, slide, Join, Knife and Bisect. Various technigues on how to use beveling and extruding to add new shapes and modifications were also introduced.</p>
